# FSJS project 3 - Interactive Form

For this project, I created validation for form fields.  The fields will be validated as you proceed through the form, and the validation
will proceed one field at a time.  

To Note:
Validation for the name field after the field loses focus.
Validation for the email and the three credit card payment fields (cc number, zip, and cvv) are done as you type in the fields.
If you do not choose an activity and either change the payment type dropdown, or type in the credit card number field, you will scroll to the Activities section and recieve an error message.
